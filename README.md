# CycleMe
Repo for Bangkit 2023 Product-based Capstone on Machine Learning Path

## The Guideline

## Main Branch
- Build_Model: This component encompasses the development of models using various transfer learning methods. It involves creating and fine-tuning models to classify waste images effectively.
- CycleMeDataset: This dataset consists of waste images categorized into eight classes. It serves as the foundation for training and validating the models.
- CycleMeDataset_Train_Validation: This dataset is derived from the CycleMeDataset and is further divided into training and validation subsets. It ensures the availability of separate data for model training and evaluation.
- Save_Model: This component involves saving the final trained model in both h5 and JSON formats. This allows for easy storage and later retrieval of the model for future use.
