After I commited from github desktop its still not resolve.
Because in github there's limited files which we can't put it to much over than 1,000 files.
And for folder Paper and Cardboard there's already 1,000 files.

GitHub say like this :
Sorry, we had to truncate this directory to 1,000 files. 597 entries were omitted from the list.
